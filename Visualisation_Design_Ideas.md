### Title: Heatmap of Crash Hotspots

### Description: 
- A geographic heatmap displaying crash densities across New Zealand. 
- The map will use colour intensity to indicate crash frequency, with red for high-density areas and blue for lower-density areas. 
- Users can filter data by year (with a slider), vehicle type (selector).
- Reveal data for region at that point in time on hover 
- Maybe display an image on each region of the vehicle type that it comparitvely has the most crashes for for that period


### Justification of design:  
- **Colour**: The use of **heatmap colours** (red â†’ blue) clearly communicates crash density, making high-risk areas stand out at a glance.
- **Position & Spatial Encoding**: The **geographic mapping** allows for natural **spatial understanding** of crash hotspots.
- **Transparency & Layering**: Allows filtering by **year** and **vehicle type**, helping to track trends over time without overwhelming the user.
- **Image Representation**: Associating a **vehicle image** with the highest crash type reinforces recognition and adds an intuitive **symbolic** element.
- **Interactive Elements**: **Hover effects** enhance engagement, making the data more accessible.

### Title: Linegraph comparisons of crashes in different regions

### Description: 
- Users can **select up to 4 regions** to compare crash trends.
- **X-axis**: Time (adjustable & animated).
- **Y-axis**: Number of crashes.
- **Filters**: Crash **Severity** and **Vehicle Type**.

### Justification of design:  
- Allows easy comaprision of crash stats between regions over time
- **Line Thickness & Colour**: Different regions will be represented by **distinct line colours**, ensuring easy differentiation.
- **Motion (Animation)**: Time-based changes are animated to allow for smooth trend visualisation.
- **Position & Alignment**: Ensures clear comparisons of crash patterns over time.
- **Filtering & Focus**: Allows users to refine data views, preventing visual overload.


### Title: Horizontal bar graph comparing most common speed of crashes

### Description: 
- A **horizontal bar graph** showing the number of crashes for each **speed limit** during a selected time period.
- **Displayed alongside the heatmap** for cross-referencing crash locations with speed limits.
- Uses **road sign icons** as a visual key (e.g., **speed limit signs**) to match the road safety theme.
- They should smoothly change positions
- Example https://rtl.co.nz/product/rg0130-132/speed-limit-signs

### Justification of design:  
- **Length & Position**: The **bar length** directly represents crash frequency, making differences easy to compare.
- **Icons & Symbols**: Using **speed limit signs** instead of just numbers improves readability and thematic consistency.
- **Categorical Colour Coding**: Different speed categories (e.g., urban vs. highway speeds) can be **colour-coded** to reinforce the meaning.
- **Dual Representation**: Placing it **next to the heatmap** allows for an immediate connection between speed limits and crash-prone areas.

### Title: Breakdown of Crashes by Road Features

### Descripton: 
- A **bar graph** showing the number of crashes bero
- Features such as *signage*, *stop signs*, and *lanes* may impact the chances of crashes. These could be explored by using something such as a radio buttons.
- Grouping by severity could provide additional breadth of information for those interested.

### Justification of design:
- **Length and Position:** by using frequency in bar plots, we make it easy to make Quantitative comparisons between different groups. 
- **Interactive Elements** from radio buttons allow for more depth in data to be displayed on the same chart. It may also allow for limited comparison between different features correlation with crash severity. 
- **Distinct Grouping** using bars for various severities allow users to differentiate injus 
- This design would be very useful for civil engineers such as Anton. Here, he would have interest in how features impact road incidents.

### Title: Time Series of Crashes

### Descripton: 
- A Time Series of crashes over time, with data displayed via a line graph.
- **x-axis** involves year.
- **y-axis** involves frequencies of crashes.
- Can be broken down by region. Can be picked out from a larger map.
- Additionally, the graph can be split by severity (e.g., minor, serious, fatal), with separate lines for each severity group, allowing for comparison over time.Can break down things by severity, with seperate groups on a line graph. 


### Justification of design: 
-  Longitudinal view allows users to track trends and patterns in crashes over time. The line graph effectively communicates the progression of crashes from year to year, making it easy to identify peaks, declines, or consistent trends.
Breakdown by region provides a way for users to focus on specific areas and understand how crashes have evolved in different locations across New Zealand.
- Severity breakdown adds another layer of insight, allowing users to differentiate between crash types and assess if certain severity levels have increased or decreased over time.
- Intuitive design with clear time-based progression and the ability to filter by regions and severity ensures that users can quickly derive meaningful insights from the data.
- This design is beneficial for transportation agencies, city planners, and policymakers who need to understand long-term crash trends and target specific regions or crash types for further investigation or intervention.

### Title: Crash Trends by Weather Conditions 

### Descripton: 
- A line graph or stacked area chart that shows crash trends in relation to weather conditions (rain, snow, fog, clear).
- The graph would display the number of crashes over time, grouped by weather condition.
- Allows users to compare how weather patterns impact crash frequencies.
### Justification of design: 
- Weather Influence is a key factor in many road accidents, and this graph would provide actionable insights into how weather affects crash frequency.
- Comparison over time allows users to track how weather-related crashes have changed or worsened over the years.
- Civil engineers and road safety officials could use this data to plan road improvements, weather-related warnings, and allocate resources during adverse conditions.
