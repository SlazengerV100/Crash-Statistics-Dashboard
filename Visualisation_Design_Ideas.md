### Title: Heatmap of Crash Hotspots

### Description: 
- A geographic heatmap displaying crash densities across New Zealand. 
- The map will use colour intensity to indicate crash frequency, with red for high-density areas and blue for lower-density areas. 
- Users can filter data by year (with a slider), vehicle type (selector).
- Reveal data for region at that point in time on hover 
- Maybe display an image on each region of the vehicle type that it comparitvely has the most crashes for for that period


### Justification of design:  
- **Colour**: The use of **heatmap colours** (red â†’ blue) clearly communicates crash density, making high-risk areas stand out at a glance.
- **Position & Spatial Encoding**: The **geographic mapping** allows for natural **spatial understanding** of crash hotspots.
- **Transparency & Layering**: Allows filtering by **year** and **vehicle type**, helping to track trends over time without overwhelming the user.
- **Image Representation**: Associating a **vehicle image** with the highest crash type reinforces recognition and adds an intuitive **symbolic** element.
- **Interactive Elements**: **Hover effects** enhance engagement, making the data more accessible.

### Title: Linegraph comparisons of crashes in different regions

### Description: 
- Users can **select up to 4 regions** to compare crash trends.
- **X-axis**: Time (adjustable & animated).
- **Y-axis**: Number of crashes.
- **Filters**: Crash **Severity** and **Vehicle Type**.

### Justification of design:  
- Allows easy comaprision of crash stats between regions over time
- **Line Thickness & Colour**: Different regions will be represented by **distinct line colours**, ensuring easy differentiation.
- **Motion (Animation)**: Time-based changes are animated to allow for smooth trend visualisation.
- **Position & Alignment**: Ensures clear comparisons of crash patterns over time.
- **Filtering & Focus**: Allows users to refine data views, preventing visual overload.


### Title: Horizontal bar graph comparing most common speed of crashes

### Description: 
- A **horizontal bar graph** showing the number of crashes for each **speed limit** during a selected time period.
- **Displayed alongside the heatmap** for cross-referencing crash locations with speed limits.
- Uses **road sign icons** as a visual key (e.g., **speed limit signs**) to match the road safety theme.
- They should smoothly change positions
- Example https://rtl.co.nz/product/rg0130-132/speed-limit-signs

### Justification of design:  
- **Length & Position**: The **bar length** directly represents crash frequency, making differences easy to compare.
- **Icons & Symbols**: Using **speed limit signs** instead of just numbers improves readability and thematic consistency.
- **Categorical Colour Coding**: Different speed categories (e.g., urban vs. highway speeds) can be **colour-coded** to reinforce the meaning.
- **Dual Representation**: Placing it **next to the heatmap** allows for an immediate connection between speed limits and crash-prone areas.
