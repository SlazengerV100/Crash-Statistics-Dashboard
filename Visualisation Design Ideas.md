### Title: Heatmap of Crash Hotspots

### Description: 
- A geographic heatmap displaying crash densities across New Zealand. 
- The map will use colour intensity to indicate crash frequency, with red for high-density areas and blue for lower-density areas. 
- Users can filter data by year (with a slider), vehicle type (selector), weather conditions (dropdown), and road type (dropdown).

### Justification of design:  
- A heatmap provides a good way to visualize crash-prone areas
- Helps engineers and drivers identify dangerous locations. 
- It also allows for easy trend analysis over time, highlighting areas that may require safety interventions.
- Good use of colour visual variable
