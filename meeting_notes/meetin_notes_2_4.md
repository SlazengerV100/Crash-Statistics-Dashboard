## Project structure
- Create a Single Page Application (SPA) with three visualizations.
- Ensure the visualizations are visually appealing and easy to understand, even for a general audience.
- data hooked up to a backend

## CSV data to transfer to SQL
- Transfer file to SQL database (unsure what type yet) which will be local
- Make a schema for the database

## Technology Choices
- **Database:** maybe SQLite instead of PostgreSQL for its lightweight nature and ease of setup.
- **Frontend:** Use JavaScript and React, leveraging team members’ experience.
- **Visualization Libraries:**
    - D3.js
    - Recharts
    - Flexibility to choose based on developer preference and visualisation we are making.

## Development Considerations
- Keep both the backend and frontend simple for faster development.
- Use SQLite for easy local database management, avoiding PostgreSQL’s complexities (MAYBE).
- Plan for handling data migration and modifications within SQLite.

## Next Steps
- **Kahu:** Set up a database schema and backend choice to populate a backend from the CSV file.
- **Zarn:** Migrate the frontend to JavaScript.
