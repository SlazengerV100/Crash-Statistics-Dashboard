## Agenda
1. **Review Design Ideas**
1. **Delegate work for remainder of design/protype phase**

## Notes & Decisions
- Disussion of region only heatmap or coordinate heatmap
    - Kahu made a heat map prototype that shows the number of crashes split by region
    - Anthony made another version this but the heatmap was generated with specific coordinates of the crash so it is much more detailed
    - We debated on the best version but landed on a hybrid approach where when viewing all of NZ it would be by region, then when you zoom in/click on a region it will shift to the coordinate bases heat map. This is the full Nview is not overwhelming but the user can still zoom in and see those clusters which is very useful info for identifing high crash zones.

- Discussion of horizontal bar graphs
    - Alex made a prototype of horizontal bar graphs showing number of crashes with certian features.
    - We decided the graph comparing speeds of crashes was not very helpful as the data os very much the same every year with 50km being the highest by far then 100km with about half that and the rest are negligable
    - We decided the vehicle and weather condition horizontal bat graphs could be useful especially if they are displayed when clicking into a region

- Talked about the region compare line graph visualisation next:
    - Compared two region selection processes: map map selection and by looking up region
    - Landed on by looking up a region as we thoought this would be more user friendly, easier to implement with current dataset which has regions as their regional councils.

- Discussed a new visualisation idea which highlights how certain crash features (vehicle, weather, speed) influence the level of severity of the crash. We all agreed this would be a very useful visualisation

- Kahu brought up
