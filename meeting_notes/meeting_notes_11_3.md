## Agenda
1. **Decide on dataset**
1. **Decide on project management methodology**
1. **Decide on what deliverables we want to produce from the design phases**
---

## Notes & Decisions
- Multiple datasets were suggested including: 
    - NZ Drivers licence pass rate
    - NZ traffic dataset
    - Hawkes bay/Gisborne flooding data
    - NZ vehicle crashes

- After a long discussion we landed on the NZ vehicle crashes dataset. This was becuase it was a full of features, all contained in one csv and we think there will be many interesting ways to visualise the data which will be beneficial for many groups

- Decided for the next 3 weeks we would work on the design and prototyping phase before me even started to think about coding. We decided on these steps:
    1. Generate 3 personas of people who might want to use a NZ Vehicle crash data visualisation system as well as specific use cases of these people. This will helo use generate design ideas which will have utility.
    1. Each team member to generate 3-4 design ideas and describe them with text. Each design idea needs justifiaction for its usefulness and how it incorperates [visual variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_variable)
    1. Next, each team member would select the best 2 ideas and create a selection of prototype designs (hand drawn, Figma, interactive)
    1. Only once we have our prototypes finalised and have ensured their effectivenes, will we start implementation. 

## Action Items
| Task | Due Date |
|------|----------|
| Create personas | 20/3 |
| Create use cases | 20/3 |
| Create 12 - 16 design ideas with justifiaction | 20/3 |
| Create prototypes of 8 design ideas | 25/3 |

## Next Meeting
**Date & Time:** 24/3 5:45pm
