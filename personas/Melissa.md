## About

Melissa Carter is a florist by trade and an artist at heart. She runs a boutique floral shop in Auckland, curating elegant arrangements for weddings, events, and everyday celebrations. To her, flowers aren’t just decorations—they’re expressions of emotion, moments captured in petals and color.

Beyond her business, Melissa is a devoted mother of three, often found cheering on the sidelines at soccer games or organizing weekend get-togethers. She thrives in social settings, enjoys making her home and shop visually inviting, and has a keen eye for design in everything—from interiors to fashion to the way an app is laid out.

Melissa has little patience for clunky, unattractive designs, whether it’s a poorly decorated space or an unintuitive website. She values simplicity, elegance, and functionality, expecting things to work well and look good while doing it. If something is visually overwhelming or dull, she won’t hesitate to move on to something better.
