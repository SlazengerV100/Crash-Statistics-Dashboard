## About

Chris Thompson has spent over a decade in the Hamilton police force, dedicating himself to keeping the city safe. While he handles a range of duties, he has taken a particular interest in the local boy racer scene. He understands that for many young people, cars are a passion—but he also sees the dangers that illegal street racing and reckless driving bring to the community.

Rather than taking a purely punitive approach, Chris prefers to engage with car enthusiasts, educating them about road safety and working with local groups to create safer alternatives for those who love modifying and driving cars. He frequently attends community events, speaks at local schools about responsible driving, and liaises with local businesses to improve safety in high-risk areas.

Outside of work, Chris is a family man. He enjoys spending time with his wife and kids, often taking them on road trips across New Zealand—where he, of course, can’t help but critique the road conditions and driving habits of others. He’s also a big fan of classic cars, which sometimes helps him connect with the very drivers he’s trying to guide towards safer choices.

## Use Characteristics
**Use Case 1: Monitoring and Investigating Crash Hotspots**  
Chris can use the system to track crash occurrences in areas known for boy racer activities. By visualizing crash locations along with factors like time, speed, and weather conditions, he can identify hotspots that may need increased patrols or community interventions. This insight helps him balance law enforcement with community engagement while focusing on targeted safety measures.

**Use Case 2: Community Outreach and Preventative Education**  
The system can provide visual data that highlights trends related to reckless driving and crash patterns. Chris can use these clear, data-driven visuals during community meetings or school presentations to educate young drivers about the risks associated with illegal racing and unsafe driving practices. This evidence-based approach supports his goal of connecting with the community and promoting road safety proactively.
