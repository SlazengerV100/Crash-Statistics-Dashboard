## 1. Introduction  
Assignment 1 is worth **40% of the overall course grade** and involves implementing an **information visualization software prototype** using **D3 or Unity**. This group project consists of two main deliverables:  
- **25%** - Individual report on the visualization design, implementation, and critique.  
- **15%** - Group project assessed on the quality of the visualization, codebase, and accompanying video.

The project is expected to take approximately **40 hours per individual**.

## 2. Dataset:

[NZ Crash Analysis System](https://opendata-nzta.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8d684f1841fa4dbea6afaefc8a1ba0fc_0/explore?location=-39.509339%2C176.882313%2C14.05)


---

## 3. Development Tools 
- The prototypes for our designs will be created with **Figma** [SWEN422 A1 Prototypes](https://www.figma.com/design/181flhWNbnQZYzVdjHhDSP/SWEN422-A1-Prototypes?node-id=0-1&t=geMkkD2KuGIUkiin-1)
- The visual system will implemented using **D3.js** ([d3js.org](https://d3js.org/))
- We will use **React** as the front end framwork 

The visualization system will be indirectly assessed through the **final report and project video**.

## 6. Assignment Timeline  

| Week  | Task |
|-------|------|
| **1 & 2** | Attend lectures on InfoVis techniques, submit team formation. |
| **3** | Meet team, select dataset, experiment with D3/Unity, create paper prototypes, set up GitLab issues. |
| **4** | Create personas, create use cases, create paper prototypes, develop designs using **Figma**. |
| **5-6** | Implement and test visualizations, draft individual reports. |
| **7** | Finalize reports, create project video, submit final deliverables. |

---

## 7. Grading  

### 7.1 Team Project Code - Group Grade (15%)  
The group will receive an overall grade based on:  
- **Visualizations (60%)**  
- **Code Base (20%)**  
- **Project Video (20%)**  

Each group must submit a **video demonstration** (YouTube/Vimeo link) showcasing the project.  
ðŸš« **Do not commit the video file to GitLab.**

---

### 7.2 Individual Final Report - Individual Grade (25%)  
Each member submits a **2,500-3,000 word report** covering:  
- **Key design/implementation decisions**  
- **Justifications & alternative designs**  
- **Critique of visualizations and tools (D3, Unity, Unreal, frameworks used, etc.)**  
- **Use of citations and references from course readings**  

#### Prerequisites for report'
| Report must include | Action Required |
|---------------------|-----------------|
|Justification of design choices like the use of visual variable | Read the readings and do research to come up with design choices that can be backed up |
| Discussion of alternative designs | Do more Figma prototypes for designs than number of designs we will implement and also we need to sit down and justify why we chose the ones we did |
| Critique of our final design| Keep a log of critiques and failures of our design with justifications to refer back to for report |
| Critique of the development tools | Keep a log of critiques of decvelopement tools to refer back to for report |

#### Report Formatting  
- **Filename:** `SWEN422-Assignment-1-final-username.pdf`  
- **Length:** Max **3,500 words** (excluding images, tables, and references)  
- **Submission:** **PDF only** via the ECS online submission system  

### Individual Grade Breakdown  
| Component | Weighting |
|-----------|----------|
| Written Communication | 25% |
| Key Design Decisions | 25% |
| Justifications & Alternative Designs | 25% |
| Visualization & Development Tools Critique | 25% |
