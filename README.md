## 1. Introduction  
Assignment 1 is worth **40% of the overall course grade** and involves implementing an **information visualization software prototype** using **D3 or Unity**. This group project consists of two main deliverables:  
- **25%** - Individual report on the visualization design, implementation, and critique.  
- **15%** - Group project assessed on the quality of the visualization, codebase, and accompanying video.

The project is expected to take approximately **40 hours per individual**.

---

## 2. Goals  
The primary goal of this assignment is to design and implement a software system for **information visualization** that allows a user to **interactively explore a dataset**. The visualization system should help users identify **trends and patterns** and must include at least **three visualizations**.

---

## 3. Data  
The dataset must be sourced from **[data.govt.nz](https://www.data.govt.nz/)** and approved by **Craig Anslow**. The dataset attribution should be included in the **codebase and individual reports**.

### Possible Datasets

| Title | Link |
|-------|------|

---

## 4. Visualization System  
- The system should be implemented using **D3.js** ([d3js.org](https://d3js.org/)) or **Unity** ([unity.com](https://unity.com/)).  
- **Unreal Engine** ([unrealengine.com](https://www.unrealengine.com/)) is permitted for VR development.  
- **PowerBI and Tableau are NOT allowed** for implementation but can be used for prototyping.  
- Additional external libraries are permitted, but assessment is based on what is added to the design and implementation.  

The visualization system will be indirectly assessed through the **final report and project video**.

---

## 6. Assignment Timeline  

| Week  | Task |
|-------|------|
| **1 & 2** | Attend lectures on InfoVis techniques, submit team formation. |
| **3** | Meet team, select dataset, experiment with D3/Unity, create paper prototypes, set up GitLab issues. |
| **4** | Develop designs using **Figma** or another tool. |
| **5-6** | Implement and test visualizations, draft individual reports. |
| **7** | Finalize reports, create project video, submit final deliverables. |

---

## 7. Grading  

### 7.1 Team Project Code - Group Grade (15%)  
The group will receive an overall grade based on:  
- **Visualizations (60%)**  
- **Code Base (20%)**  
- **Project Video (20%)**  

Each group must submit a **video demonstration** (YouTube/Vimeo link) showcasing the project.  
ðŸš« **Do not commit the video file to GitLab.**

---

### 7.2 Individual Final Report - Individual Grade (25%)  
Each member submits a **2,500-3,000 word report** covering:  
- **Key design/implementation decisions**  
- **Justifications & alternative designs**  
- **Critique of visualizations and tools (D3, Unity, Unreal, frameworks used, etc.)**  
- **Use of citations and references from course readings**  

#### Report Formatting  
- **Filename:** `SWEN422-Assignment-1-final-username.pdf`  
- **Length:** Max **3,500 words** (excluding images, tables, and references)  
- **Submission:** **PDF only** via the ECS online submission system  

### Individual Grade Breakdown  
| Component | Weighting |
|-----------|----------|
| Written Communication | 25% |
| Key Design Decisions | 25% |
| Justifications & Alternative Designs | 25% |
| Visualization & Development Tools Critique | 25% |
